A physics engine is a software component that simulates the physical behavior of objects in a virtual environment.
In game development, physics engines are used to create realistic and interactive game worlds, 
where objects move and interact with each other according to the laws of physics.

Here are some key concepts and terms related to physics engines:

Collision detection: The process of detecting when two or more objects in a game world collide or intersect with each other. 
This is a fundamental task in physics engines, as it determines how objects interact with each other.

Rigid body dynamics: The simulation of the physical movement and interaction of solid objects in a game world.
This includes the effects of gravity, friction, and other physical forces.

Soft body dynamics: The simulation of the physical movement and interaction of non-solid objects in a game world, such as cloth, fluids, or gases.

Constraints: Rules that restrict the movement or interaction of objects in a game world.
Constraints can be used to create realistic simulations of joints, hinges, or other physical structures.

Raycasting: A technique for simulating the movement of light rays in a game world.
Raycasting is often used for collision detection, as it can quickly determine whether a ray intersects with an object.

Collision response: The process of determining how objects should react when they collide or interact with each other.
This includes calculating the forces that act on objects, such as the impulse of a collision or the friction between two surfaces.
