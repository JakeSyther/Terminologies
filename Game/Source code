In game terminology, source code refers to the programming code that makes up a video game.
It is the underlying language that the game is built upon, and it contains all of the instructions that tell the game how to function.

The source code is typically written in a programming language such as C++, Java, or Python, and it is compiled into machine code
that the computer can understand and execute.

Game developers use source code to create all aspects of the game, including the graphics, sound, gameplay mechanics, and user interface.
They can modify the source code to add new features, fix bugs, and optimize performance.

In many cases, game developers will release the source code for their games to the public, allowing fans to modify and customize the game as they see fit.
This can lead to the creation of mods, fan-made levels, and even entirely new games based on the original source code.

Overall, source code is a critical component of video game development, as it is what allows developers to bring their creative visions to life and create immersive,
engaging gaming experiences for players.
